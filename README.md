# Mini Project 2
We made use of a merge sorter because one of the stipulations was that it needed to be faster or equal to o(Log n).  
We found out that we had to use a merge sorter or a heap sort. Unfortunately with the way heap sort works, it is unstable meaning that the first person that comes into the queue, does not always come out first which we found to be an issue.  
This left us no choice but to use a merge sorter.
